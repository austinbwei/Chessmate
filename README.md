   If you do not know how to play chess or need a refresher feel free to go through this short section! 

#### Start Game 

   This will first take you through a 5 question preliminary assessment to gauge your skill level when you go against the AI. Afterwards you will select the color you wish to play as and then start the game. 
   
   To make a move while it's your turn, click on the piece you want to move, drag it to the tile you want to place it, and release the mouse button to make your move. You'll notice that as you select a piece there will be blue circles...these are indicating the piece's possible moves while the numbers inside of them indicates the rated effectiveness of that move. 
   
   At any point you can request a move from an AI on the right panel and it will give you a move recommendation. You'll also notice game updates appear on this panel which will tell you the status of the game such as when a player is in check, checkmate, or stalemate. 
   
#### Phase Suggestion
   
   When the game is complete, a 'Phase Suggestion' option will apear which you can go through to play a game in an AI determined phase.
